                        Project. Over the course of 20+ years, many events were analyzed, including celebrations
                        of New Years, large-scale meditations and religious events and shocking events like the
                        terror attacks and natural tragedies. The composite statistic for the project shows a
                        7-sigma departure from expectation, indicating a probability on the order of 1 in a

                        fluctuation. The evidence clearly suggests
                        that focused emotional energy and attention can interact with and affect the physical
